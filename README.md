# qSticky
qSticky is an automated port forwarding manager for Gluetun and qBittorrent. It automatically updates qBittorrent's listening port whenever Gluetun receives a new forwarded port.

## Features
- üîÑ Automatic port synchronization
- üëÄ Real-time file watching with fallback polling
- üîí Secure HTTPS support
- üê≥ Docker support
- üìù Logging

## Quick Start

### Port Forwarding Setup

qSticky needs access to Gluetun's forwarded port file to function. When Gluetun successfully sets up port forwarding, it writes the port number to `/tmp/gluetun/forwarded_port`. This file is monitored by qSticky to detect port changes.

To give qSticky access to this file, you need to:
1. Enable port forwarding in Gluetun by setting `VPN_PORT_FORWARDING=on`
2. Mount the Gluetun volume containing this file into the qSticky container
3. Ensure both containers share network access (using `network_mode: "service:gluetun"`)

A working Gluetun configuration might look like:
```yaml
services:
  gluetun:
    image: qmcgaw/gluetun:latest
    volumes:
      - /your/gluetun/folder:/tmp/gluetun  # This folder must be mounted in qSticky
    environment:
      - VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER=protonvpn
      - VPN_TYPE=wireguard
      - VPN_PORT_FORWARDING=on
```

### Using Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  qsticky:
    image: ghcr.io/monstermuffin/qsticky:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /your/gluetun/folder:/tmp/gluetun
    network_mode: "service:gluetun"
    environment:
      - QSTICKY_QBITTORRENT_HOST=localhost
      - QSTICKY_QBITTORRENT_PORT=8080
      - QSTICKY_QBITTORRENT_USER=admin
      - QSTICKY_QBITTORRENT_PASS=adminadmin
      - QSTICKY_USE_HTTPS=false
      - QSTICKY_PORT_FILE_PATH=/tmp/gluetun/forwarded_port
      - QSTICKY_CHECK_INTERVAL=30
      - QSTICKY_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Configuration

All configuration is done through environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| QSTICKY_QBITTORRENT_HOST | qBittorrent server hostname | localhost |
| QSTICKY_QBITTORRENT_PORT | qBittorrent server port | 8080 |
| QSTICKY_QBITTORRENT_USER | qBittorrent username | admin |
| QSTICKY_QBITTORRENT_PASS | qBittorrent password | adminadmin |
| QSTICKY_USE_HTTPS | Use HTTPS for qBittorrent connection | false |
| QSTICKY_PORT_FILE_PATH | Path to Gluetun forwarded port file | /tmp/gluetun/forwarded_port |
| QSTICKY_CHECK_INTERVAL | Fallback check interval in seconds | 30 |
| QSTICKY_LOG_LEVEL | Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) | INFO |
| HEALTH_FILE | Path to health status file | /tmp/health/status.json |

### Health Checks

qSticky includes Docker health. The health status is written to a file at `/app/health/status.json`, this is done to avoid publishing any ports. Health status includes:
- Overall health status
- Uptime
- Last check timestamp
- Last port change time
- Current port
- Last error (if any)

The Docker container will be marked as unhealthy if:
- The application fails to write health status
- qBittorrent becomes unreachable
- Port updates fail repeatedly
- Other critical errors occur

When running outside of Docker, ensure the `/app/health` directory exists and is writable by the running user. The health file location can be customized using the `HEALTH_FILE` environment variable.
